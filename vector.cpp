/* vector.cpp

 * Author: Richard Townsend

 *
 * Purpose: Implement a Vector class similar to (but more limited than) the
 * standard C++ vector. A vector is basically an array that can dynamically grow
 * (or shrink) to hold more (or remove) elements as needed. The user of a vector
 * should not have to worry about how the elements are actually stored under the
 * hood (this will motivate which fields/methods should be private).
 *
 * 
 * Rules about a vectors fields that must be true at the start and end of any
 * of our vector's methods:
 *  1. 0 <= size <= capacity
 *  2. capacity >= 1
 *  3. If the vector is not empty, buffer[0] stores the first element
 *  4. If the vector is not empty, buffer[size - 1] is the last element
 *

 *  3. Constructors are automatically called when an object is created. 
 *  4. Without this constructor, a new vector's fields would be garbage. */
